This project is part of my University of Chicago summer research, focused on building a text classification system to detect stereotypes or biased representations in humorous content.


The goal of this project is to identify and categorize bias present in English jokes. The model classifies jokes into 3 categories such as:

Classification (5 labels)
Target (11 labels)
Rhetoric (15 labels) 

Technologies Used:
Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)

OpenAI API and Microsoft Phi for classification & labeling

Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and experimentation


I worked on instruction/fine-tuning for the classification and Rhetoric label for Microsoft Phi while also working on all three categories for Open ai. My teammates worked on the target category forr Microsoft Phi which is why the notebook is not listed.
